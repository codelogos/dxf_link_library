dxfengine
=========
The source code produces a dll that can be dropped into a windows project to allow access to R12 2D dxf files (the most current dll is located in the dll subdirectory). The code is in for some significant revision as it is > 12 years old. A sample dxf viewer written in C# will be posted shortly.
